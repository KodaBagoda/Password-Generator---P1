## Python Password Generator

This repository contains a Python script for generating secure and random passwords.

**Features:**

* Generates passwords of user-specified length.
* Includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for increased complexity.
* Offers the option to exclude specific character sets (e.g., no symbols).

**Dependencies:**

This project requires no external libraries and uses only the built-in Python `random` module.

**Usage:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using `python password_generator.py` (or the equivalent command for your system).
4. The script will prompt you for the desired password length and any character exclusions (optional).
5. A strong, random password will be generated and displayed on the console.

**Example:**

```
python password_generator.py

Enter desired password length (minimum 8 characters): 16
Exclude symbols (y/n)? n

Your generated password: Up#t2hJ!s3crEtPa$$
```

**Contributing:**

Feel free to fork this repository and make improvements! Here are some ideas:

* Implement options for password strength meters.
* Allow users to save generated passwords to a file (securely!).
* Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

**License:**

This project is licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE file for details).

**Security Considerations:**

* It's recommended to never store passwords in plain text. Consider using a password manager for secure storage.
* Ensure the script is not running on a public or shared computer.


**Getting Started with Python (Optional):**

* If you're new to Python, there are many resources available online to help you get started, including official documentation and tutorials: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

We hope this password generator helps you create strong and secure passwords for all your online accounts!
